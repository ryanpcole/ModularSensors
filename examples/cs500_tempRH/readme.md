# Development of CS500 analog temp/rH sensor module
I'm basing this on the analog EC module that is reads electrical conductivity from the ADC. Hopefully it's a similar analog interface I can modify to work on a the temp/rH sensor.

## TODOs
-[] look through the AnalogElecConductivity module and modify header file
-[] modify the cpp file so it calculates the right values of temp and rH
